    "# The Fab Four: An Exploration of the Beatles Solo Careers Through Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beatles were a revolutionary Rock n' Roll group that were active throughout the 1960's and 70's. In their early years they brought together blues and rock n' roll style with the modern form of the four man rock band. Over the groups career they each developed their own styles and sounds as musicians which then influenced there individual solo careers. Although each of them are talented in their own way they all received varying levels of commercial and critical success. This data analysis takes a look at how each members popularity stands today among modern listeners.  \n"

    "Paul has the highest popularity with 44 songs on 30 datasets. Ringo has the lowest with 2 songs spread over 5 playlists. John was the second most popular with 32 songs in 26 playlists and George was the third with 27 songs over 18 playlists. These results can be attributed to a number of factors. For exampl, Paul is still alive releasing new music while George and John passed away while they were still making new albums. Another reason is due to overall style. George, John, and Ringo produced eclectic music that appealed to more niche groups of people while Paul released more widely accepted music. "
