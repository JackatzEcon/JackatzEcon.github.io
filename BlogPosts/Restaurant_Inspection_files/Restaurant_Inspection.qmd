## Loading in Data

```{r}
restaurant <- read_csv(
  'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv'
)
```

This dataset has 17633 observations and 12 variables. It contains information on health and hygiene rankings. Each restaurant has information about location, type of cuisine and performance on health inspections.

## Creating Descriptive Statistics

```{r, include=TRUE}
Q1a <- restaurant %>% 
  group_by(GRADE) %>% 
  summarise(SD_value = sd(SCORE),
            first_quartile = quantile(SCORE, 0.25),
            median_value = median(SCORE),
            third_quartile = quantile(SCORE, .75),
            MAX_value = max(SCORE))
```

### Relationship between Grade and Score

Box plots can show us the relationship between a character variable and a quantitative variable.

```{r}
ggplot(data = restaurant)+
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = GRADE, y = SCORE))

```

###Relationship between grade score and critical flag

```{r}
ggplot(data = restaurant)+
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = `CRITICAL FLAG`, y = SCORE))
```

### In this ggplot graph we can see which `Cuisine Description` has the highest proportion of Grade A rankings

```{r}
Q1e <- restaurant %>% 
  group_by(`CUISINE DESCRIPTION`) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(-count) %>% 
  head(n = 10)

Q1e
```

```{r}
Grades <- restaurant %>% 
  filter(`CUISINE DESCRIPTION` %in% c(Q1e$`CUISINE DESCRIPTION`))
Grades
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = Grades)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = `CUISINE DESCRIPTION`, 
                         y = after_stat(prop),
                         group = GRADE,
                         fill = GRADE))
```

From this ggplot we can see that donuts have the highest proportion of A grades for health.

### Most popular restaurant type

```{r}
Q1f <- restaurant %>% 
  group_by(`DBA`) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>%   
  arrange(desc(count))

Q1f
```
